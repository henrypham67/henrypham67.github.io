## 👋 Hi, I'm Henry!

My full name is **Phạm Minh Hiếu** (in Vietnamese), but I go by Henry. I'm a Vietnamese DevOps Engineer with a passion for building reliable platforms and automating everything.

## 💼 Professional Journey

I've been in the tech industry for **4 years**, starting as a Backend Engineer for 1 year before transitioning to DevOps Engineering for the past 3 years. How did I get into tech? Honestly, I chose it randomly - but it turned out to be one of the best random decisions I've ever made!

I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** from Ton Duc Thang University.

### What I Do

Currently, I'm focused on:

- **Building platforms** that make developers' lives easier
- **Kubernetes** orchestration and management
- Cloud infrastructure on **AWS**
<!-- - **MLOps** - bringing machine learning to production -->

### Technical Skills

My toolkit includes:

- **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS
- **Programming:** Python, Golang
- **Operating Systems:** Linux
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL

## 📝 Why I Write

This blog serves as my digital notebook where I:

- Take notes on things I'm learning
- Summarize complex topics in my own words
- Journal my learning journey
- Share my personal experiences with technology

Think of it as learning in public - documenting the messy, real process of figuring things out.

## 🎯 Beyond Tech

When I'm not working with clusters and pipelines, you might find me:

- Playing **badminton** 🏸
- Enjoying a cup of **matcha** 🍵
- Still figuring out what other hobbies I'm into 😄

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always open to:

- Collaboration on interesting projects
- Networking with fellow engineers
- Consulting opportunities
- Just chatting about tech!

Feel free to reach out through any of the channels linked on this site. Whether you want to discuss Kubernetes, share feedback on my posts, or just say hi - I'd love to hear from you!
